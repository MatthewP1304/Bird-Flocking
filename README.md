# Bird-Flocking

This project provides several agent-based simulations to investigate the effects of drone use on protecting farmland from birds. The simulation builds on the ``boids'' model developed first by Craig Reynolds and implements repelling bodies to represent the drones along with fine tuning coefficent values. With this simulation multiple configurations of drones were tested including both moving and stationary as well as several movement patterns and their results were compared to determine the most effective and cost-efficient solution.

The code was developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
